# Todo: Write an informative README.md file

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(stringr)
```

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

dc_permits_2020 <- 
  read_csv("data/Building_Permits_in_2020.csv", 
                            col_type = cols(
                              LATITUDE = col_character(),
                              LONGITUDE = col_character()
                            )) %>% 
  rename_with(tolower)



```
